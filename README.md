# Repeater (REPL tool) [WIP]

The object is developing using REPL more fast and with ease. How this extension tries to achieve this is accepting a terminal command for opening whatever REPL you use with the options that you want, then you run the desired code from your file with a shortcut.

## Features

### Use any REPL with any options
Set the terminal command for opening the desired REPL with some options (if needed).

### Run Code!
Select some code and run by calling vscode command
__Repeater (REPL Tool): Run selected code__.

**Tip**: bind this command with some shortcut - [how?](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings)

## Requirements
The REPL that you going to use :P
