# Repeater (REPL tool)

The object is developing using REPL more fast and with ease. How this extension tries to achieve this is accepting a terminal command for opening whatever REPL you use with the options that you want, then you run the desired code from your file with a shortcut.

## Features

### Use any REPL with any options
Set the terminal command for opening the desired REPL in the VSCode settings.
